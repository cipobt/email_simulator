# Email Simulation Program

This program is an interactive simulation of an email inbox. With this program, users can:

- Check their inbox
- Read emails
- Mark emails as spam
- Send (simulate) new emails
- Delete emails from their inbox

## Color Codes for Output Menu and Messages

The program uses ANSI escape sequences to provide colored output for a more visually appealing experience. The colors available include:
- Pink
- Blue
- Cyan
- Green
- Yellow
- Red
- White (for default)

Additionally, text can be displayed in bold and underline styles.

## Core Features

### Email Class

A main `Email` class defines the structure for an email object. Each email has attributes for:
- Content
- Sender address
- Read status
- Spam status

### Inbox Management

The program initializes an inbox with a few dummy emails for demonstration purposes. Users can interact with the inbox in various ways, including:
- Checking all emails
- Reading individual emails
- Sending new emails
- Marking emails as spam
- Deleting emails

The program displays messages using the color codes, enhancing the readability and user experience.

### Error Handling

To provide a robust user experience, the program includes basic error handling to prevent unexpected crashes from invalid inputs.
